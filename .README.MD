# BeyondChats Article Manager

A small full‑stack application that exposes a JSON articles API using Laravel and a single‑page UI built with React. The project demonstrates a clean separation between the backend API and the frontend client.

### 2. Data Flow Diagram

End‑to‑end data flow for typical interactions:

1. User opens the Vercel URL and loads the React SPA.
2. SPA calls `GET /api/articles` and `GET /api/articles/{id}` on the Laravel API.
3. Laravel reads data from SQLite and returns JSON.
4. SPA renders article list and detail views.
